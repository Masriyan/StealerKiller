## ü¶† Supported Infostealer Families

StealerKiller can detect and remove the following families of information stealers:

| Stealer Family | Targeted Data | Detection Methods |
|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| LummaC2 | Browser data, crypto wallets, 2FA applications | Signature, Network, Memory |
| RedLine | Browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, FTP clients | Signature, Behavioral |
| Raccoon | Browser data, cryptocurrency wallets | Signature, File Analysis |
| Vidar | Browser credentials, crypto wallets, screenshots | Signature, Behavioral |

## üîß Technical Approach

StealerKiller employs a multi-layered approach to detect infostealer malware:

### 1. Signature-Based Detection

- **File Hashing**: SHA-256 comparison against known malicious files
- **String Pattern Matching**: Recognition of malicious code patterns
- **Registry Analysis**: Identification of suspicious registry keys and values

### 2. Behavioral Analysis

- **Process Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious process behavior
- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Identification of connections to known C2 servers
- **File System Monitoring**: Detection of suspicious file access patterns

### 3. MITRE ATT&CK Framework Integration

The detection techniques are aligned with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, focusing on:

- **T1555**: Credentials from Password Stores
- **T1539**: Steal Web Session Cookie
- **T1005**: Data from Local System
- **T1119**: Automated Collection
- **T1071**: Application Layer Protocol
- **T1041**: Exfiltration Over C2 Channel

## üìä Scan Types

| Scan Type | Description | Use Case |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Quick Scan | Rapid analysis of common infostealer locations | Daily use, initial screening |
| Deep Scan | Comprehensive system analysis | Periodic security assessments |
| Memory Scan | Analysis of running processes | When suspicious activity is noticed |
| Network Scan | Detection of C2 communications | When suspicious connections are suspected |
| Registry Scan | Analysis of registry for persistence mechanisms | When persistence is suspected |
